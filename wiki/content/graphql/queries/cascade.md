`@cascade` is available as a directive that can be applied to fields. With the @cascade
directive, nodes that donâ€™t have all fields specified in the query are removed.
This can be useful in cases where some filter was applied and some nodes might not
have all the listed fields.

For example, the query below would only return the authors which have both reputation
and posts and where posts have text. Note that `@cascade` trickles down so it would
automatically be applied at the `posts` level as well if it's applied at the `queryAuthor`
level.

```graphql
{
    queryAuthor @cascade {
        reputation
        posts {
            text
        }
    }
}
```

`@cascade` can also be used at nested levels, so the query below would return all authors
but only those posts which have both `text` and `id`.

```graphql
{
    queryAuthor  {
        reputation
        posts @cascade {
            id
            text
        }
    }
}
```

### Parameterized Cascade

cascade is sometimes very strict because for a node to be in response, all its children in the sub-graph must be present. 
Instead, to consider all fields in cascade, we give flexibility to the user to specify fields as an argument to cascade as below.

`@cascade(fields:["field1","field2"..])` 

In the below example argument field "name" is used as an argument to cascade and forwarded to the next query level also. So for author 
to be in query response it should have a name and if has a subfield country then that should also have name.
```graphql
queryAuthor  @cascade(fields:["name"]) {
		reputation
		name
		country {
                Id
				name
		}
	}
```
Following query ensures authors which has post field should also have text subfield in it.
```graphql
queryAuthor {
		reputation
		name
		posts @cascade(fields:["text"]) {
			   title
			   text
		}
	}
```
Also, these fields are  forwarded to the next query level unless there is a cascade at the next level, 
in that case, arguments to cascade are overwritten.
The below query ensures that the author should have field reputation and name. And if it has subfield posts then that should also have
field text in it.

```graphql
queryAuthor @cascade(fields:["reputation","name"]) {
		reputation
		name
		dob
		posts @cascade(fields:["text"]) {
				title
				text
			 }
		}
```
